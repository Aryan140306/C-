# C-
## Struct
Help us to create a user defined datatye of different size.\
We can not give value to any variable in structure \
we can make array of variable length eg(char ch[6])

## Size of different data types
int-2 byte\
float-4 byte\
char- 1 byte\
pointer variable-2 byte

## Nested Structure 
we can call a struct in another struct 

## Use of different symbols
### *
  eg(*a) value in a , (int* a) this means a is pointer variable 
### &
  eg(&b) means address of b
### →
 eg(p→c) means *p.a

## How to assign value to variables defined in struct
we can not assign value directly in struct so we write valued in(let struct b)\
eg- struct b s1={write values according to data type in struct}
